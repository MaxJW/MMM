Max's Magic Mirror - As the official one refuses to run on my Raspberry Pi 1

I've created a completely web based version of the project, using the extremely helpful website [MagicMirrorCentral](https://www.magicmirrorcentral.com/dash/), to hopefully be able to simply launch up chromium on the pi, connect to this website (whether via LAMPP or online hosting), and enjoy my mirror!

This is obviously not very modular, compared to the very sophisticated MagicMirror<sup>2</sup> repository, so make sure to check them out if you've arrived here somehow!
